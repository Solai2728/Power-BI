# World Cup

Problem Statement:

The World Cup generates massive amounts of data across teams, players, matches, goals, and historical performance. Stakeholders—including coaches, analysts, fans, and media—need a comprehensive, interactive dashboard to analyze team and player performance, track historical trends, and gain insights from past tournaments.

However, raw data from multiple sources is often unstructured and scattered, making it difficult to:

Compare team and player statistics across tournaments,
Analyze performance trends over time,
Identify key players or game-changing moments,
Understand regional or continental dominance,
Visualize live or aggregated performance metrics in an intuitive way.

Objective:

Develop an end-to-end Power BI dashboard that:
Ingests and transforms historical World Cup data (e.g., match scores, player stats, goals, team rankings).

Creates visualizations to explore:

 Competetition stats by year, Countries Qualified to the world cup, World Cup Winner, 
Countries Hosted the world cup


Tools Used:

Power BI for visualization,

Power Query for data transformation,

DAX for calculated metrics,

Excel/CSV/API as data sources.
